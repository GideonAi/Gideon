# Gideon

---

An attempt to recreate Gideon form DC Legends that is compatable with most voice technology like Cortana from windows and Alexa from amazon.

# How it works:
```sh
1. Voice software turns what you are saying into text
2. Data gets sent to Api.ai or Dialogflow for responce
3. TTS or Text To Speech tells you what the responce is with audio.
```
